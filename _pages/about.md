## Research: Sensitivity Analysis of Soil Parameters in Crop Model

High-throughput computing allows us to speed up the computations by more than thirty times and increase the number of sampling points significantly. We identify soil indicators that play an essential role in crop yield productivity and show that their influence is the highest in the topsoil layer.


Heatmap shows how the variability in soil parameters affects the yield in the crop simulation model

Investigations of the biological transformation of hydrocarbons in soils are based on the concept of limited bioavailability of hydrocarbons (as well as other hydrophobic organic pollutants) due to the distribution of hydrocarbons molecules within the soil matrix with the formation of various bonds with different components. Thus, the determination of the bioavailable fraction of hydrophobic organic pollutants is an important issue.
