Investigations of the biological transformation of hydrocarbons in soils are based on the concept of limited bioavailability of hydrocarbons (as well as other hydrophobic organic pollutants) due to the distribution of hydrocarbons molecules within the soil matrix with the formation of various bonds with different components. Thus, the determination of the bioavailable fraction of hydrophobic organic pollutants is an important issue.
