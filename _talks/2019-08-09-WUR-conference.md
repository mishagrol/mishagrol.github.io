The necessity for intensification of agriculture in densely populated areas of South-East Asia leads to the active use of fertilizers and pesticides. For the pest management of rice farms,
farmers often use neonicotinoids. It is known that humic substances (HS) affect the behavior of organic pollutants in the environment. HS can bind toxicants, changing their migration ability, and provide a stimulating effect on the soil microbial community, accelerating the decomposition process of organic pollutants.
