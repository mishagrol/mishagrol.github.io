The course is devoted to series of frequently asked
questions from people who start their scientific computing life with
Linux. We'll give a masterclass for a work within the ssh-session,
standard terminal commands and their combinations, tips on organization
of the simplest possible bash-scripts (loops, background calculations,
IO-redirections, etc.).
